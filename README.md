Module 4 Challenge for UM Bootcamp

# Overview
In this challenge, I created and manipulated Pandas DataFrames to analyze school and standardized test data.  The data produced will help the school board an mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

# District Summary
I used python code and pandas within visual studio code to create a district summary containing the calculations for:
 - total number of students,
 - total budget,
 - average math & reading scores,
 - number of students who passed math, reading and both
 - also included is a new DataFrame for the calculations

# School Summary
I used python code and pandas within visual studio code to create a district summary containing the calculations for:
 - Schools & their types
 - Total student counts
 - Per Capita Spending
 - Average Test scores
 - Number of students with math scores of 70 or higher
 - Number of students with reading scores of 70 or higher
 - Number of students that passed both with scores of 70 or higher
 - Passing rates
 - also included is a new Data Frame for the calculations

# Also Included:
 - Highest Performing Schools by Percentage of Overall Passing
 - Lowest Performing Schools by Percentage of Overall Passing
 - Math Scores by Grade
 - Reading Scores by Grade
 - Scores by School Spending
 - Scores by School Size
 - Scores by School Type
